# Secure-Password-Generator

## Overview and Description 
- This challenge is all aboout taking a provided code for HTML and CSS and the outline of a JavaScript file and finsihing the code to make a password generate. When the user clicks n the webpage, a red button with "generate password" is there and once it is clicked, it asks the user a series of questions regarding what type of characters they want in their question. The user can choose what they want and if they do not answer it alerts them that they must choose a selection. 
- This challenge is important because it reinforces the basic concepts of JavaScript and it shows different way to create a password. This challenege was difficult because there are many ways to go about it. I learned a lot about arrays and how to get the display box to pop up and make ure that once "ok" or "cancel" is clicked, that input is used for the final response: the password. 
- This challenge uses the basics of JavaScript including if statements, arrays, variables, and functions.
- This challenge was difficult because I was using the Math.floor and math.random completely wrong and it took it me a long time to finally see that I had to use it for every single category for the prompts and add the array to that randomly generated string. One thing I hope to improve in the fututre is my pseudo code at the beginning to help map out the steps easier and not hesistate to use outside sources.
